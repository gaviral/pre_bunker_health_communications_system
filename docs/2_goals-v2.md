# PRE-BUNKER Health Communications System - Goals v2.0

## 🎯 **One-Line Vision**
A multi-agent "wind-tunnel" for health communications that simulates how different audiences will misread, distort, or weaponize a draft—then rewrites and equips it with evidence-backed prebunks before it goes live.

## 🚨 **Problem & Opportunity**
Most harm comes from ambiguous phrasing and fast-moving guidance. Today we detect misinformation **after publication**; PRE-BUNKER moves that detection and correction upstream to **design time**.

## ⚙️ **How It Works (5-Stage Pipeline)**

### 1. **Audience Simulator**
Agent personas (demographics, beliefs, literacy) stress-test drafts with adversarial paraphrases and "clip-and-share" heuristics.

### 2. **Claim Extractor & Risk Scorer** 
Pulls implicit/explicit claims; scores misinterpretability and harm potential; highlights "high-risk" sentences.

### 3. **Evidence Gatekeeper**
Links each claim to trusted sources (WHO/CDC/Cochrane/local guidelines); flags contradictions and missing citations.

### 4. **Countermeasure Studio**
Generates prebunks, FAQs, provider talking points, and short social copy tailored to likely misunderstandings.

### 5. **Ops Orchestrator**
Routes through human review, logs rationale, and schedules small-scale A/B tests; learns from feedback to refine personas and risk models.

## 📦 **Outputs**

### Primary Deliverables
- **Revised, citation-bound message** with risk mitigation
- **Prebunk kit** (micro-copy, visuals, SEO snippets)
- **Risk report** (top failure modes, fixes, confidence scores)

### Secondary Assets
- **Reusable personas** and evaluation rubrics for future campaigns
- **Performance metrics** and improvement recommendations

## 🚀 **Pilot Strategy (Fast Path)**
Start with one topic (e.g., naloxone myths or RSV guidance). 

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduction in high-risk claims per message
- Improved comprehension in small user tests  
- Fewer incident flags post-launch

## 🔬 **Research Value**

### Academic Contributions
- Introduces a measurable **Misinterpretability@k** metric
- Releases an anonymized corpus of "flagged-and-fixed" sentences
- Enables ablations (with/without simulation, with/without evidence binding)

### Publication Potential
- **Venues**: Health-informatics and HCI conferences
- **Impact**: Immediately useful to public-health partners
- **Reproducibility**: Open methodology and evaluation framework

## 🎯 **Why It Resonates**

### Domain Fit
- Squarely in **health informatics + NLP**
- Concrete impact on **substance-use and outbreak communications**
- Credible path from prototype to deployment in **university-public-health collaboration**

### Market Readiness
- Addresses urgent need in public health communication
- Scalable solution for health organizations
- Evidence-based approach with measurable outcomes
