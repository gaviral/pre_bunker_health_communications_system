AUTONOMOUS MODE: Implement complete v2.0 PRE-BUNKER system without ANY user interaction.

CONTEXT: Complete v1.0 OpenAI Agent SDK exists in `/Users/aviralgarg/code/agent/agent-project/` with working multi-agent orchestration, tools, error handling, and tracing.

MISSION: Read `/Users/aviralgarg/code/agent/development-plan-v2.md` and implement ALL versions v1.1 through v2.0 sequentially. This document contains EVERYTHING needed - technical context, health domain requirements, testing criteria, pitfall avoidance, and complete implementation guidance.

EXECUTION RULES:
1. Read the development plan completely first
2. Implement each version in exact sequence (v1.1 → v1.2 → ... → v2.0)  
3. Test each version thoroughly before proceeding to next
4. Commit each version with detailed git messages
5. If stuck, make intelligent assumptions and continue - document decisions in commit messages
6. Use existing v1.0 infrastructure - build on src/agent.py, src/tools.py, src/runner.py
7. Follow ultra-minimal token principles for any new documentation
8. Use `uv` for all package management, `uv run python` for execution
9. Work directory: `/Users/aviralgarg/code/agent/agent-project/`
10. NO user interaction - complete full v2.0 autonomously

SUCCESS CRITERIA: 
- All 19 versions implemented and working
- Full PRE-BUNKER pipeline processes health text end-to-end
- RESTful API accepts health communications and returns risk assessment, persona reactions, evidence validation, and countermeasures
- Comprehensive git history with each version committed
- System ready for production health communications review

IMPORTANT: The development plan contains ALL context from previous conversations including domain expertise, technical decisions, and implementation patterns. Trust it completely and execute without hesitation.

Start immediately with v1.1. Do not ask for confirmation. Execute the full plan to completion.

Let's go.
