One‑line: A multi‑agent “wind‑tunnel” for health communications that simulates how different audiences will misread, distort, or weaponize a draft—then rewrites and equips it with evidence‑backed prebunks before it goes live.

Problem & opportunity Most harm comes from ambiguous phrasing and fast‑moving guidance. Today we detect misinformation after publication; PRE‑BUNKER moves that detection and correction upstream to design time.

How it works (pipeline) 1. Audience Simulator: agent personas (demographics, beliefs, literacy) stress‑test drafts with adversarial paraphrases and “clip‑and‑share” heuristics. 2. Claim Extractor & Risk Scorer: pulls implicit/explicit claims; scores misinterpretability and harm potential; highlights “high‑risk” sentences. 3. Evidence Gatekeeper: links each claim to trusted sources (WHO/CDC/Cochrane/local guidelines); flags contradictions and missing citations. 4. Countermeasure Studio: generates prebunks, FAQs, provider talking points, and short social copy tailored to likely misunderstandings. 5. Ops Orchestrator: routes through human review, logs rationale, and schedules small‑scale A/B tests; learns from feedback to refine personas and risk models.

Outputs • A revised, citation‑bound message; a prebunk kit (micro‑copy, visuals, SEO snippets); a risk report (top failure modes, fixes, confidence). • Reusable personas and evaluation rubrics for future campaigns.

Pilot (fast path) Start with one topic (e.g., naloxone myths or RSV guidance). Success metrics: reduction in high‑risk claims per message, improved comprehension in small user tests, and fewer incident flags post‑launch.

Research value Introduces a measurable Misinterpretability@k metric; releases an anonymized corpus of “flagged‑and‑fixed” sentences; enables ablations (with/without simulation, with/without evidence binding). Publishable in health‑informatics and HCI venues; immediately useful to public‑health partners.

Why it resonates Squarely in health informatics + NLP; concrete impact on substance‑use and outbreak communications; credible path from prototype to deployment in a university‑public‑health collaboration.
