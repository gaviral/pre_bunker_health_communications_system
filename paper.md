## PRE-BUNKER: Multi-Agent Upstream Health Misinformation Prevention

Shifts health misinformation prevention from reactive post-publication detection to proactive design-time intervention via systematic audience simulation and evidence-backed prebunking.

**Innovation**: **Misinterpretability@k** metric quantifies communication risk by measuring top-k persona misinterpretation proportion, enabling systematic improvement.

### Contributions

**Framework**: 5-stage pipeline (claim extraction→risk assessment→audience simulation→evidence validation→countermeasures), 12 personas, 15-source database (WHO/CDC/Cochrane/FDA/PubMed/Mayo/AAP/AMA/Nature/NHS/AHA/ACS/NIMH)

**Metrics**: Misinterpretability@k (66.67%→0% reduction), Evidence Coverage Score, Risk Reduction Score

**Implementation**: Feature-complete prototype (19 versions v1.1-v2.0) with performance/reliability limitations, 20 test evaluations, FastAPI interface, human review, A/B testing, adaptive learning

### Methodology

**Upstream Prevention**: "Wind-tunnel" stress-testing via adversarial paraphrasing, evidence binding with contradiction flagging, targeted prebunking (FAQs, talking points, social copy)

**Evaluation**: Ablation studies, anonymized corpus generation, baseline benchmarking

### Results

**Performance**: 47-67% effectiveness improvement (50% risk reduction, 67% misinterpretability reduction), 50% persona operational rate (6/12 functional, LLM timeouts), 12-14 minutes processing (optimization required)

**Architecture**: Error handling, async execution, human review workflows

### Impact

**Applications**: Public health agencies, healthcare organizations, policy research

**Research**: Novel misinterpretability metrics (Communication Science), proactive AI harm prevention (AI Safety), multi-agent testing (HCI)

**Reproducibility**: Source code, 20 test logs, evaluation protocols

### Significance

First systematic, quantitative framework for upstream health misinformation prevention. Misinterpretability@k enables evidence-based improvement while multi-agent personas provide audience interpretation insights. Establishes proactive health communication paradigm with immediate public health and long-term AI optimization applications.
