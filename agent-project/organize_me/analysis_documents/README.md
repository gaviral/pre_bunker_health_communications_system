### `comprehensive_issues_analysis.md` (512 lines)

- Includes technical debt analysis and recommendations
- Very comprehensive but extremely long

## Investigation Questions

1. **Is this a reference document or active documentation?** - Appears to be comprehensive reference
2. **Should this be in a `docs/` directory?** - If it's valuable documentation, yes
3. **Is this still current/accurate?** - Based on test logs, so should be accurate
4. **Is the length appropriate or should it be summarized?** - 512 lines is very long for regular reference

## Recommendation

**If valuable for reference:**
- Move to `docs/` directory as `docs/issues-analysis.md`
- Consider creating a shorter executive summary version
- Keep the full version for detailed investigation

**If obsolete:**
- Archive or delete if the issues have been resolved
- The analysis was based on historical test logs, so value depends on current relevance

The document appears to be high-quality analysis but its size makes it impractical for regular consultation.
