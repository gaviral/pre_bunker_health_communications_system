# Log Directories Investigation

This directory contains multiple log directories that were created over time with overlapping purposes.

## Contents

### `current_logs/` (26 files)
- Contains "detailed logs" numbered 1-26 for versions v1.1 through v2.0
- Files like: `1_v1_1_detailed_log.txt`, `20_v2_0_detailed_log.txt`, etc.
- These appear to be the most recent/authoritative logs

### `legacy_logs/` (12 files)  
- Contains older "detailed logs" for versions v1.9 through v2.0
- Files like: `v1_9_detailed_log.txt`, `v2_0_detailed_log.txt`, etc.
- These appear to be older versions of the same logs

### `test_runner_outputs/` (4 directories)
- Timestamped directories from August 26, 2025: 
  - `test_logs_20250826_090022/`
  - `test_logs_20250826_090202/` 
  - `test_logs_20250826_090220/`
  - `test_logs_20250826_090255/`
- Contains test runner execution logs and summaries
- Shows test execution attempts with mostly failures due to missing dependencies

## Investigation Questions

1. **Which logs are authoritative?** - current_logs vs legacy_logs overlap
2. **Should test runner outputs be archived or deleted?** - These are execution logs, not source logs
3. **Do we need all historical versions?** - Some logs might be redundant
4. **Should any be moved to a proper `logs/` directory?** - If they're valuable for reference

## Recommendation

- Keep `current_logs/` as the authoritative log set (move back to project as `logs/`)
- Archive or delete `legacy_logs/` (redundant with current_logs)  
- Delete `test_runner_outputs/` (temporary execution logs, not valuable long-term)
