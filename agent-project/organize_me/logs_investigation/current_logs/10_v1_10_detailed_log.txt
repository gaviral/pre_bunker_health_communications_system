=== Testing Risk Reporter Initialization ===
✅ Risk reporter initialized with agent: RiskReporter

=== Testing Base Metrics Calculation ===
Base metrics calculated:
  Total claims: 3
  High-risk claims: 1
  Average risk score: 0.53
  Evidence coverage rate: 0.67
  Personas with concerns: 2
✅ Base metrics calculation working correctly

=== Testing Risk Level Determination ===
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 1, 'average_risk_score': 0.5, 'personas_with_concerns': 1, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.8} → high_risk (expected: high_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.8, 'personas_with_concerns': 0, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.9} → high_risk (expected: high_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.5, 'personas_with_concerns': 1, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.8} → medium_risk (expected: medium_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.3, 'personas_with_concerns': 2, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.8} → medium_risk (expected: medium_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.2, 'personas_with_concerns': 0, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.3} → medium_risk (expected: medium_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.2, 'personas_with_concerns': 0, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.9} → low_risk (expected: low_risk)
Metrics: {'high_risk_claims': 0, 'average_risk_score': 0.1, 'personas_with_concerns': 1, 'evidence_coverage_rate': 0.7} → low_risk (expected: low_risk)
✅ Risk level determination logic working correctly

=== Testing Key Findings Extraction ===
Key findings extracted: 3
  - CRITICAL: 2 high-risk claims detected requiring immediate revision
  - EVIDENCE GAP: Only 30.0% of claims have supporting evidence
  - AUDIENCE RISK: 3/4 audience segments show significant concerns
✅ Key findings extraction working correctly
