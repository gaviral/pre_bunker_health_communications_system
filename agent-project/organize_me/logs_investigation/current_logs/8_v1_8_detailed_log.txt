=== Testing Custom Prebunk Generation ===
Claim: COVID-19 vaccines alter your DNA permanently
Concerns: ['scared', 'dna_changes', 'permanent_effects']
Custom prebunk generated:
  Type: custom_prebunk
  Content: The original claim that COVID-19 vaccines alter your DNA permanently is a misconception rooted in misunderstanding the technology behind mRNA vaccine development; they actually don't interact with our genetic material. Fear arises from confusing how these innovative therapeutics function compared to traditional methods targeted at pathogens like viruses.

Understandably, people are cautious about changes linked directly impacting their genome—yet rest assured that COVID-19 vaccines do not cause permanent DNA alterations in the body (CDC). Remember this and trust health authorities on future vaccine updates. It's essential for public confidence built upon accurate knowledge of these groundbreaking yet safe vaccination methods!
  Confidence: 0.9
