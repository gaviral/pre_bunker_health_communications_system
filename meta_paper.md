   - **Missing Populations**: No personas for minority communities, non-English speakers, or specific vulnerable populations
   
2. **Evaluation Bias**:
   - **Creator Bias**: Personas designed by system creators may reflect unconscious biases
   - **Validation Gap**: No independent validation of persona authenticity or representativeness
   - **Cultural Assumptions**: Western/US-centric health communication assumptions
   
3. **Ethical Framework Gaps**:
   - **IRB Approval**: No human subjects research approval for persona validation
   - **Consent Issues**: No consent mechanism for populations represented by personas
   - **Harm Assessment**: Limited analysis of potential harm from biased prebunking

### Statistical Rigor Limitations
1. **Baseline Validity**: Arbitrary baseline thresholds without empirical validation
