# Agent Development Project

## Executive Summary

This project contains two major development phases for building an intelligent agent system:

### Development Plan v1.0: OpenAI Agent SDK Foundation
**Goal**: Build a complete foundational agent framework with LLM integration and multi-agent orchestration.

**What it achieved**: A fully functional agent system featuring:
- **Core Agent Class** with async execution and tool integration
- **LLM Integration** using local Ollama phi4-mini model
- **Function Tool System** with automatic schema generation via `@function_tool` decorator
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** with ContentPlanner and Writer agents
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** with logging and graceful failures
- **Execution Tracing & Monitoring** with performance metrics and dashboard
- **Web Search Capabilities** through DuckDuckGo integration

**Status**: âœ… **Complete** - All 10 versions (v0.1-v1.0) successfully implemented and tested

### Development Plan v2.0: PRE-BUNKER Health Communications System
**Goal**: Transform the agent foundation into a specialized "wind-tunnel" system for health communications that simulates audience reactions and prevents misinformation.

**What it builds**: A sophisticated health misinformation prevention system featuring:
- **Multi-Agent Audience Simulation** with diverse personas (vaccine-hesitant, health-anxious, chronic illness patients, healthcare professionals)
- **Advanced Claim Extraction** that identifies health claims with confidence scoring and risk assessment
- **Evidence Validation Gateway** that verifies claims against authoritative sources (WHO, CDC, Cochrane, FDA, PubMed)
- **Intelligent Countermeasure Studio** that generates persona-targeted prebunks and clarifications
- **Ops Orchestration** with human review queues, A/B testing, and learning systems

**Core Innovation**: The PRE-BUNKER pipeline processes health communications through 5 stages:
1. **Claim Extraction** - Identifies health claims and risk patterns
2. **Risk Scoring** - Assesses misinterpretation potential using medical accuracy criteria
3. **Persona Simulation** - Tests messages with different audience types to predict reactions
4. **Evidence Validation** - Links claims to authoritative health sources with trust scores
5. **Countermeasure Generation** - Creates targeted prebunks addressing specific persona concerns

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planned** - Comprehensive 19-version roadmap (v1.1-v2.0) ready for implementation

### Technical Foundation
- **Language**: Python 3.13.7 with `uv` package management
- **LLM**: Local Ollama phi4-mini for privacy and control
- **Architecture**: Modular agent system with comprehensive error handling and tracing
- **Domain Focus**: Health communications with medical accuracy requirements
- **Deployment**: FastAPI web service with human review workflows

This project represents a complete evolution from general-purpose agent framework to specialized health misinformation prevention system, leveraging the robust foundation built in v1.0 to address critical public health communication challenges.
