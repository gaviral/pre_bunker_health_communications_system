# Agent Development Project

## Executive Summary

This project contains two major development phases for building an intelligent agent system:

### Development Plan v1.0: OpenAI Agent SDK Foundation
**Goal**: Build a complete foundational agent framework with LLM integration and multi-agent orchestration.

**What it achieved**: A fully functional agent system featuring:
- **Core Agent Class** with async execution and tool integration
- **LLM Integration** using local Ollama phi4-mini model
- **Function Tool System** with automatic schema generation via `@function_tool` decorator
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** with ContentPlanner and Writer agents
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** with logging and graceful failures
- **Execution Tracing & Monitoring** with performance metrics and dashboard
- **Web Search Capabilities** through DuckDuckGo integration

**Status**: ✅ **Complete** - All 10 versions (v0.1-v1.0) successfully implemented and tested

### Development Plan v2.0: PRE-BUNKER Health Communications System
**Goal**: Transform the agent foundation into a specialized "wind-tunnel" system for health communications that simulates audience reactions and prevents misinformation.

**What it builds**: A sophisticated health misinformation prevention system featuring:
- **Multi-Agent Audience Simulation** with diverse personas (vaccine-hesitant, health-anxious, chronic illness patients, healthcare professionals)
- **Advanced Claim Extraction** that identifies health claims with confidence scoring and risk assessment
- **Evidence Validation Gateway** that verifies claims against authoritative sources (WHO, CDC, Cochrane, FDA, PubMed)
- **Intelligent Countermeasure Studio** that generates persona-targeted prebunks and clarifications
- **Ops Orchestration** with human review queues, A/B testing, and learning systems

**Core Innovation**: The PRE-BUNKER pipeline processes health communications through 5 stages:
1. **Claim Extraction** - Identifies health claims and risk patterns
2. **Risk Scoring** - Assesses misinterpretation potential using medical accuracy criteria
3. **Persona Simulation** - Tests messages with different audience types to predict reactions
4. **Evidence Validation** - Links claims to authoritative health sources with trust scores
5. **Countermeasure Generation** - Creates targeted prebunks addressing specific persona concerns

**Status**: 🚧 **Extensively Implemented** - All 19 versions (v1.1-v2.0) have substantial implementations with some integration issues

## Bird's Eye View: See It In Action

Here's what our PRE-BUNKER system actually does, using a real example from our test logs:

### 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**
Imagine a public health agency wants to share this message:
> *"The new COVID-19 vaccine is 100% safe and completely effective for everyone. It has no side effects and prevents all infections guaranteed."*

**The Risk**: This message uses dangerous absolute language ("100%", "guaranteed", "no side effects") that could backfire with different audiences.

### 🔬 **What Our System Does** (Step-by-Step Demo)

**Step 1: Smart Detection** 🔍
- **System finds**: 2 health claims in the message
- **Flags dangerous words**: "100% safe", "completely effective", "guaranteed", "no side effects"
- **Risk assessment**: 🔴 **HIGH RISK** - Absolutist language detected

**Step 2: Audience Simulation** 🎭
- **Tests message with 4 different personas**:
  - 😟 **Vaccine-Hesitant Parent**: "This sounds too good to be true, what are they hiding?"
  - 🏥 **Healthcare Professional**: "No medical intervention is 100% anything - this undermines credibility"
  - 📱 **Social Media User**: "Perfect for sharing, but friends will call this propaganda"
  - 👵 **Elderly Caregiver**: "I trust medical advice, but 'guaranteed' makes me suspicious"

**Step 3: Evidence Check** 📚
- **Searches trusted sources**: WHO, CDC, FDA, PubMed
- **Finds**: Real vaccine data shows 85-95% efficacy, rare side effects exist
- **Verdict**: Claims don't match authoritative evidence

**Step 4: Smart Fixes** 🛡️
- **Generates 2 improved versions**:
  - *"Clinical trials show the COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective (85-95%) with rare, manageable side effects. Most people experience significant protection."*
  - *"The COVID-19 vaccine provides strong protection for most people. Like all medical treatments, individual results may vary. Consult your healthcare provider."*

**Step 5: Final Report** 📊
```
🔴 Risk Assessment: HIGH RISK
📊 Claims: 2 total, 2 high-risk  
🎭 Personas: 4 analyzed (all showed concerns)
📚 Evidence: Claims don't match scientific data
🛡️ Countermeasures: 2 safer versions generated
⏱️ Analysis completed in 12 minutes
```

### 🎯 **The Result**
Instead of accidentally spreading a message that could damage trust, the health agency gets:
1. **Clear warning** about why the original message is risky
2. **Specific insights** on how different audiences will react
3. **Better alternatives** that maintain trust while conveying the same information
4. **Evidence-backed recommendations** from authoritative health sources

**This is PRE-BUNKING in action** - catching and fixing communication problems before they reach the public.

> 💡 **Technical Details**: For developers and technical stakeholders, comprehensive implementation analysis is available in `agent-project/organize_me/PRIORITY_QUEUE.md`

### Technical Foundation
- **Language**: Python 3.13.7 with `uv` package management
- **LLM**: Local Ollama phi4-mini for privacy and control
- **Architecture**: Modular agent system with comprehensive error handling and tracing
- **Domain Focus**: Health communications with medical accuracy requirements
- **Deployment**: FastAPI web service with human review workflows

This project represents a complete evolution from general-purpose agent framework to specialized health misinformation prevention system, leveraging the robust foundation built in v1.0 to address critical public health communication challenges.
